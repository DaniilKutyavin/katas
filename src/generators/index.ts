  The goal of this kata is to implement pseudo-generators with ES5.

  `generator(sequencer[, arg1, arg2, ...])` receives a sequencer function 
  to generate the sequence and returns an object with a next() method. 
  When the next() method is invoked, the next value is generated.
  The method could receive as well optional arguments to be passed to the sequencer function.
*/

export function generator<T, K extends unknown[]>(
  sequencer: (...args: K) => () => T,
  ...args: K
) {
  return {
    next: sequencer(...args),
  };
}
